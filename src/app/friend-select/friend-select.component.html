          <li><b class="bold">Bio</b>: Brandon loves computers and camping. He takes his new laptop with him wherever he goes. That way he can program AND camp at the same time. Cool. Brandon's never liked playing with regular toys, action figures, or that kind of thing. In fact, he hates puppets. He had a clown puppet when he was little, and some mornings when he woke up, he'd find it had moved closer to him. Once it even had a kitchen knife in its hand. Brandon's pretty sure his big brother, Chris, was messing with him. But he still hates puppets. <br><br> Brandon sometimes sees Zoe's family when they go camping. Zoe usually hides in the tent with her dolls, though. Yuck. Brandon delivers the newspaper to Professor Longfellow (in his big old freaky house) and to Missy's family. Brandon's greatest fear is of puppets, particularly clown puppets.</li>

          <li><b class="bold">Bio</b>: Father Rhinehardt was born in Munchen, Germany (or Munich, as Americans call it). He moved with his family to America when he was 15... and then got beaten up for the next three years. Father Rhinehardt turned to religion for the reasons why people treated him so badly. Eventually, he entered Seminary and became a priest. Since that day, long ago, many people have confessed their sins to him. But there is one man who haunts him, every few years, a stranger who sits in the confessional and whisperes of murder and madness. In recent years, Father Rhinehardt has found he's starting to agree with the madman's arguments. Blood, pain, death-they are all part of life, of God's plan, are they not? <br><br> Father Rhinehardt is familiar with Vivian and Madame Zostra from seeing them at the Something Written bookstore. He knows Ox from hearing him confess his petty sins. He also knows Missy from her appearances at Sunday school. More than anything, Father Rhinehardt fears going mad. </li>

          <li><b class="bold">Bio</b>: Flash isn't the most original name ever for someone as fast as Darrin. But he likes it. It's comfortable and fits him, just like his favorite pair of track shoes. Darrin lives to run and runs to live. When he's not running, Darrin feels like there's something coming for him... something Not Good. Even when he runs, the wind sometimes whispers in his ears, and he swears he can hear the Not Good Thing coming up behind him - fast. No wonder he's the star of the track team. <br><br> Flash knows Jenny from the neighborhood. She's ok, but she's real quiet. He's known Madame Zostra for his entire life. After all, he's her nephew. Zoe's his little cousin, but he's only met her a couple of times. Darrin's greatest fear is that he's going to be caught by the Not Good Thing (whatever it is). </li>

She practices 'medicine' on anyone who will let her. She even cuts up dead frogs and stuff she finds in her yard. But sometimes that gets bad, and she dreams of dead frogs hip-hopping into her bed at night and smothering her.

She started out working part time sitting in the window of an occult bookstore, but now she has her own home astrology business. Although Madame Zostra reads cards for a living, she won't ever read her own cards. She is terrified that she'll see her own death in the cards, something she can't bear to think about. <br><br> Madame Zostra is familiar with Vivian and Father Rhinehardt form seeing them at Vivian's bookstore.

Jenny's greatest pleasure is curling up alone in a tiny place reading a gigantic book-the older the book, the better. The books keep her from dwelling on her mother's disapearance, that day fourteen years ago when Mom went to the store and never came back, leaving Jenny alone. Alone forever.<br><br>Jenny's only real friend is Caitlyn, Heather's older sister. Jenny also knows Ox, since she grew up only a few doors away from him on Mulberry Lane. And Jenny knows Madame Zostra from the library, a place they both adore. Jenny's greatest fear is being trapped in a crowd or lost out in the open.</li>

He likes the basketball court because that's where he can play his favorite game. He likes being under the house because it's a great place to hunt for bugs, plus it's a good place to avoid his five older brothers. Sure, all older brothers pick on their younger siblings, but Peter's brothers really pick on him. But what's a few broken bones among family? Peter loves bugs and wants to be an entomologist when he grows up-an entomologist who never has to speak to his brothers.<br><br>Peter earns extra money taking care of Professor Longfellow's yard (and finding cool bugs - bonus!). He knows Missy from school. She likes to do pretend medical exams on him and check out his real broken bones, but she doesn't like it when he shows her his bug collection.
