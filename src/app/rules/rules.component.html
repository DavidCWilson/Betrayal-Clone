  <h3>Game Overview</h3>
  <p>
    In Betrayal at House on the Hill, you choose a character to explore a creepy old house. For this experience you also get to choose a friend to explore the house with you- safety in numbers. As you explore the house, you discover new rooms. Each time you enter a new room, you might find something... or something might find <i>you.</i> Explorers get better (or worse) depending on how they deal with the house's suprises. As your make your way deeper into the house, things take a sinister turn and a "haunt" is triggered.
  </p>
  <h3>How To Play</h3>
  <h4>Exploration Phase:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Select your character and ally on the character select screens</li>
    <li>At the beginning of each turn you can either move or place a room. The number of space you can move each turn is equal to your 'speed' level. Placing a room counts as a move. Movement phase ends either when you place a room or you have moved the maximum amount of tiles.</li>
    <li>Placing a room triggers either an omen or event card to be drawn. Follow the instructings dictated by each card. Oftentimes this will involve a dice roll. </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Haunt Phase:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Once the haunt is triggered follow the instructions on the bottom of the screen to help you survive the haunt.</li>
    <li>Choose your actions wisely, you never know what the house has in store for you or your friend! The clock is ticking...</li>
    <li>During this phase if any of your stats reach a level of zero, the house wins and you will perish.</li>
  </ul>
