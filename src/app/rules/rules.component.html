    <h4>Game Overview</h4>
    <p>
      In Betrayal at House on the Hill, you choose a character to explore a creepy old house. For this experience you also get to choose a friend to explore the house with you- safety in numbers. As you explore the house, you discover new rooms. Each time you enter a new room, you might find something... or something might find <i>you.</i> Explorers get better (or worse) depending on how they deal with the house's suprises. As your make your way deeper into the house, things take a sinister turn and a "haunt" is triggered.
    </p>
    <h4>How To Play</h4>
    <h5>Exploration Phase</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Select your character and ally on the character select screens</li>
      <li>At the beginning of each turn you can either move or place a room. The number of space you can move each turn is equal to your 'speed' level. Placing a room counts as a move. Movement phase ends either when you place a room or you have moved the maximum amount of tiles.</li>
      <li>Placing a room triggers either an omen or event card to be drawn. Follow the instructings dictated by each card. Oftentimes this will involve a dice roll. </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Haunt Phase</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Once the haunt is triggered follow the instructions on the bottom of the screen to help you survive the haunt.</li>
      <li>Choose your actions wisely, you never know what the house has in store for you or your friend! The clock is ticking...</li>
      <li>During this phase if any of your stats reach a level of zero, the house wins and you will perish.</li>
    </ul>
