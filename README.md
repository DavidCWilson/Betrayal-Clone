# Betrayal at House on the Hill (for the web)

A fan-made web-based copy of the popular board game [Betrayal at House on the Hill](http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill) built by [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/) students.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Specs/Wishlist

| Pivotal Game Objects | Requirements |
|---|---|
| House | Static Foyer, random rooms |
| Item "cards" | Database Objects referencing in-game items (probably in an array?) |
| Omen "cards" | same as items, but different object/array |
| Event "cards" | see omen |
| Characters | this may be part of the stretch goals, due to complexity in routing <br> for different characters |
| Turn Counter | this is an `if` dependent on the character functionality |

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
